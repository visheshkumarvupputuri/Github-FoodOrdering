Why do we need to use react.fragment over div though both supposed to do the same purpose
  * though both serves same purpose such as grouping elements 
    * Why do we need to group elements
      * because React elements or component should definitely return only one JSX element. so in order to
        group multiple JSX tags into single JSX tag then we should definitely group the elements
  * As both serves the same purpose when we use div then this div will be added to the DOM node and this will create
    Complexity. This div is unnecessary still it is creating problem so this is one of the reasons for using reatc.fragment 
    over div tag.
  
Use React.Fragment when:

* You don't need to apply styles or attributes to the wrapper.
* You want to avoid adding unnecessary DOM elements.
* You prefer cleaner and more performant code.
* Use div or other HTML elements when:

Use div:

You need to style the wrapper.
You need a specific semantic meaning for the wrapper element.
